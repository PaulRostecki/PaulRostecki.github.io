                <h2>About Me</h2>
                <p>I am a DevOps Engineer with over 4 years of experience and a recent graduate with a Bachelor's Degree 
                    in Computer Science from <a href="https://amu.edu.pl/en">Adam Mickiewicz University</a>.
                    Currently I am furthering my education as a Master's student in Computer Science at 
                    <a href="https://www.merito.pl/english/poznan/get-to-know-wsb-merito-university">WSB Merito University Poznań</a>.</p>
                <p>I love automating stuff and I am into concepts like containers, CI/CD and IaC. 
                    As for coding, my go-to language is Python, which I admire for its simplicity.</p>
                <p>Currently working at <a href="https://www.psi.de/en/company/company-profile">PSI Software</a>,
                    where I work on maintaining development infrastructure in the cloud (both VMs and Kubernetes),
                    creating CI/CD pipelines (Jenkins) and managing apps and services on K8s using ArgoCD.</p>
                <p>Before that, for almost 2 years I worked at <a href="https://www.psnc.pl/">PSNC</a>, where I was helping
                    to maintain OpenShift instances and other internal services, as well as taking care of monitoring (Nagios),
                    all as a part of company's private cloud.</p>
                <p>As a hobby, I play strategy games, tabletop RPGs and travel, mostly around Central and Eastern Europe.</p>
